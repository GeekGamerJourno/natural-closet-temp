**Maris Top**

$149.95

I love this top. It takes me to a Noosa wedding. Nothing to over the top just relaxed and classy.

3 pieces make up the front with side detail achieving a longer profile something we all look for .Great effect teaming 2 colours together.

Dropped&nbsp; shoulder to soften the top of the arm.&nbsp;

The perfect bottoms for Maris top are our straight leg pant (long) in matching fabric.&nbsp;
