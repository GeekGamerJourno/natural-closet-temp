**Zara Top**

$149.95

A classic piece with its interesting side pleat and button detail.&nbsp;

Short or 3/4 sleeve which are cut for maximum comfort so no back pulling.

Darted bust. Side splits can be added for sitting comfort.

Straight leg pants are the perfect match.

I suggest only made in plain colours to shoe off the details.
